Leropas (LEarning ROck PAper Scissors) is a rock paper scissors bot which makes decisions based on the ratio of the most played option in the last five games. The bot is coded in Python and it has a basic decision based algorithm. It's my second Python project.

Looking it after some years, it's...certainly not perfect. Still though, considering it was recklessly coded by someone building projects with Python for the first time, it's not that bad.
